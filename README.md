Includes utilities:

* [dotenv-safe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-safe)

Development utilities:

* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
  * ``nodemon`` is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
* [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env)
    * ``cross-env`` makes it so you can have a single command without worrying about setting or using the environment variable properly for the platform. Just set it like you would if it's running on a POSIX system, and ``cross-env`` will take care of setting it properly.
